# Assignment 3 - Dynamic HTML Generation

__This assignment is worth 500 points and due 11:59PM June 30th__

For this assignment, you will be dynamically creating a web page using the mockups and fileserver you created for the prior assignments.

_You may not use external JS/CSS libraries like Bootstrap for this project!_

### Requirements
You will find the Codio Box's project folder for the assignment _final-frontier-cms_ comes pre-loaded with a _data_ folder (see the Filetree to the left, or access it from the menu with `View > Filetree`).

This folder contains a JSON file, _cards.json_, which will serve as the basis for your dynamic cards.  All assets referenced by the cards are accessible in the _public/media_ folder.

You will also find in the _src/generate-card-html.js_ the starting points for writing code to generate HTML snippets for cards.

You will need to edit and add to files to create your server implementation, conforming to the requirements laid out in the [KSOL assignment page](https://k-state.instructure.com/courses/77041/pages/assignment-number-3-dynamic-html-generation).

You can open any file by clicking it in the filetree.

### Turning In your Work
To turn in your work, you will need to select `Education > Mark as Complete` from the menu.  This will convert your box to a read-only status and inform the instructor it is ready to be graded.
